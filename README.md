# üëã Hi, I'm Hanine Bouchiba!

I am a graduate with a **Master's degree in Networks, Mobility, and Embedded Systems** from the University of Mouloud Mammeri Tizi-Ouzou. I am passionate about **software development** and **security**, with a special interest in emerging technologies.

## About Me

With a solid background in networks and embedded systems, I have gained expertise in developing and simulating innovative software solutions. My thesis focused on the **simulation of quantum network communications**, an exciting field that opens up new possibilities for secure transmissions and advanced communications.

I am constantly exploring ways to blend **technology** and **security** to solve complex problems and address future challenges.

## Technical Skills üõ†Ô∏è
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, Bash
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Tailwind CSS, Mongoose
- **Tools & Platforms**: Docker, Git, GitHub, Vite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Nginx
- **Embedded Systems**: ARM Cortex-M, Microcontrollers (STM32, Arduino,ESP32), FreeRTOS, Embedded C, UART 
- **Security**: Cryptography, Quantum Networks, SSL/TLS, OAuth, JWT, VPN,Nmap,Netsus
